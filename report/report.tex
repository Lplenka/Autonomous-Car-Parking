%\begin{description}
%Your report should provide a survey and an experimental comparison of multiple solution approaches to a particular problem. This is a critical review of at least three papers that significantly contributed to advance the state-of-the-art for the problem you are analysing. It should not be a mere summary of the papers. You are expected to conduct an analytical review of the methods under analysis to try to find common aspect and differences, connections between methods, drawbacks and open problems. Unless the faced problem has emerged recently, students should choose their papers by diversifying the range of approaches used to solve the problem. A good guideline could be to choose a paper from a decade or two ago, and a couple of more recent papers. You need to experimentally evaluate approaches in a simulation of a problem, in a range of scenarios, and analyse the pros and cons of each approach.

\section{Introduction}
%In this section, you should introduce your work: what are the motivations behind this work? What is the relevant problem that you are investigating? Why is it relevant? 
%Briefly, introduce the background information required to understand the problem and the concepts that you will develop. 
%
%This section should also contain the link to the recording of your presentation (college OneDrive link â€“ please make sure sharing permissions are such that everyone with tcd email can access it)
%
% TODO: Motivations behind this work
The Autonomous Vehicle (AV) industry is one of the most active and promising area in the recent years with many ongoing research to make it fully autonomous \cite{talavera2021autonomous}. The International Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) proposed a six-degree autonomy scale with level 0 as no automation and level 5 as full automation without any human interventions \cite{stoma2021future}. The current level of autonomy scale achieved today is between level 2 and 3 requiring some assistance from the driver and limited to ideal conditions.
%
% TODO: What is the relevant problem that you are investigating
Car parking is challenging and disliked by most drivers due to time required searching for spaces, risk of scratching vehicle, safety of pedestrian, etc \cite{baburaj2021smart}\cite{bosch_global_2022}.
%
% TODO: Why is it relevant
Most vehicles are parked $95\%$ throughout the lifetime \cite{choi2019self}. Parking is required by every driver and apply AV will greatly improve the quality of life and ease of drivers.

% TODO: Introduce background information required to understand the problem and concepts that you will developed

% TODO: Include link to recording of presentation

\section{Related Work}

\section{Problem Definition and Algorithm}
Problem definition and algorithm
%This section formalises the problem you are addressing and the models used to solve it. This section should provide a technical discussion of the chosen/implemented algorithms. A pseudocode description of the algorithm(s) can also be beneficial to a clear explanation. It is also possible to provide one example that clarifies the way an algorithm works. It is important to highlight in this section the possible parameters involved in the model and their impact, as well as all the implementation choices that can impact the algorithm.

\section{Experimental Results}
Experimental result
%This section should provide the details of the evaluation. Specifically:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Methodology: describe the evaluation criteria, the data used during the evaluation, and the methodology followed to perform the evaluation. 
%\item Results: present the results of the experimental evaluation. Graphical data and tables are two common ways to present the results. Also, a comparison with a baseline should be provided.
%\item Discussion: discuss the implication of the results of the proposed algorithms/models. What are the weakness/strengths of the method(s) compared with the other methods/baseline?
%\end{itemize}
